# Business Analysis On Olist Dataset

## Introduction

This repository contains the dashboards of a business analysis on the [Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce) available on Kaggle using Power BI. The dataset presents 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made through the Bazilian platform Olist regrouping various marketplaces. This is real commercial data presenting temporal and geographical dimensions of the orders. This project allowed to make dashboards through a Methods and Tools for Business Intelligence course at ISEP Engineering School. They were presented to and acclaimed by speakers working in the field. The objectives were to make relevant insights about the data by proposing various Key Performance Indicators and justify them through visualizations and analytics. Based on those indicators, the idea was to propose strategic decisions for businesses in order to increase profits and optimize sales depending on various factors.
